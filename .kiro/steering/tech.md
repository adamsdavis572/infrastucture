  - Multi-cloud support
  - Kubernetes-native experience
  - Composition and abstraction capabilities

### Container Orchestration
**Primary**: Kubernetes
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for container orchestration, native integration with Crossplane
- **Distribution**: To be determined based on cloud provider and operational requirements
- **Version**: Supported LTS versions

### Cloud Providers
**Multi-cloud Strategy**: Azure only at this time
  - API Management
  - Virtual Networks
  - Storage Accounts
  - CDN
  - DNS
  - Authorization/RBAC
- **Provider Management**: Crossplane provider-based architecture

## Infrastructure Components

### Composition Framework
- **Crossplane Compositions**: Reusable infrastructure patterns

- **Provider Configurations**: Cloud provider authentication and configuration

### Service Catalogue
- **API Gateway Services**: Azure API Management compositions
- **Networking Services**: Virtual networks, ingress controllers, load balancers
- **Storage Services**: Managed storage solutions with backup and encryption
- **Security Services**: Identity management, key vaults, security policies

## Development and Operations Stack

### Version Control
**Primary**: Git
- **Platform**: GitHub (assumed based on current repository structure)
- **Branching Strategy**: GitFlow or GitHub Flow (to be defined)
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo approach for platform components

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Tools**: ADO 
- **Requirements**:
  - Automated testing of Crossplane compositions
  - Infrastructure validation and security scanning
  - Multi-environment deployment support
  - Rollback capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability
**Requirements**:
- **Metrics**: Platform performance, resource utilisation, cost tracking
- **Logging**: Centralised logging for platform operations and user activities
- **Tracing**: Request tracing for troubleshooting and performance analysis
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting for platform health and user impact

**Potential Technologies**:
- Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
- ELK Stack or similar for logging
- Jaeger or similar for tracing

### Documentation Platform
**Requirements**:
- API documentation generation
- User guides and tutorials
- Architecture documentation
- Runbooks and operational procedures

**Potential Technologies**:
- GitBook, Confluence, or similar
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- Markdown-based documentation in repository

## Security and Compliance

### Identity and Access Management
- **Authentication**: Integration with enterprise identity providers
- **Authorisation**: Kubernetes RBAC for platform access
- **Multi-tenancy**: Namespace-based isolation with policy enforcement

### Security Scanning
- **Container Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment for container images
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Policy-based infrastructure validation
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data

### Compliance Framework
- **Policy as Code**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) or similar
- **Governance**: Automated compliance checking and reporting
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all platform activities

## Data Management

### Configuration Management
- **GitOps**: Git-based configuration management
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes secrets with external secret store integration
- **Configuration Validation**: Schema validation and policy enforcement

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
- **Infrastructure State**: Backup of Crossplane resources and configurations
- **Data Backup**: Automated backup of persistent data
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented disaster recovery processes

## Preferred Frameworks and Patterns

### Infrastructure Patterns
- **Composition Pattern**: Crossplane compositions for reusable infrastructure
- **GitOps Pattern**: Git-driven infrastructure deployment and management
- **Policy as Code**: Declarative policy management and enforcement

### API Design
- **RESTful APIs**: Standard HTTP-based APIs for platform services
- **Kubernetes APIs**: Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for infrastructure resources
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Standardised API documentation

### Multi-tenancy Patterns
- **Namespace Isolation**: Kubernetes namespace-based tenant separation
- **Resource Quotas**: Per-tenant resource limits and controls
- **Network Policies**: Network-level isolation between tenants

## Technology Constraints and Decisions

### Cloud Strategy
- **Primary Cloud**: Azure (based on current provider configurations)
- **Multi-cloud Readiness**: Architecture must support future cloud provider additions
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Consideration for on-premises integration if required

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Residency**: Ensure data sovereignty compliance
- **Security Standards**: Adherence to enterprise security policies
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Support for industry-specific regulations

### Performance Requirements
- **Scalability**: Platform must scale to support hundreds of teams
- **Availability**: High availability with minimal downtime
- **Performance**: Sub-minute provisioning for common infrastructure requests

### Integration Requirements
- **Enterprise Systems**: Integration with existing ITSM, monitoring, and security tools
- **Developer Tools**: Integration with existing development workflows and tools
- **Legacy Systems**: Consideration for integration with existing infrastructure

## Future Technology Considerations

### Emerging Technologies
- **Service Mesh**: Potential adoption for advanced networking and security
- **Serverless**: Support for Function-as-a-Service offerings
- **Edge Computing**: Consideration for edge infrastructure requirements

### Technology Refresh Strategy
- **Regular Updates**: Planned technology refresh cycles
- **Migration Paths**: Clear upgrade and migration strategies
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Regular assessment of technology choices and alternatives
