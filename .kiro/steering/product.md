# Product Vision and Strategy

## Product Overview

This infrastructure platform serves as a centralised service delivery layer that enables teams to provision, manage, and consume infrastructure capabilities through standardised, self-service interfaces. The platform abstracts complex infrastructure management whilst maintaining governance, security, and cost optimisation at scale.

## Vision Statement

To create a unified infrastructure platform that empowers development teams through self-service capabilities whilst ensuring standardisation, governance, and operational excellence across the organisation's infrastructure landscape.

## Target Personas

### Platform Builder
**Role**: Infrastructure and platform engineers who design, build, and maintain the platform's core capabilities.

**Key Needs**:
- Tools to create reusable infrastructure compositions
- Ability to define and enforce governance policies
- Visibility into platform usage and performance
- Extensible architecture for adding new capabilities

**Success Metrics**:
- Time to add new infrastructure capabilities
- Platform reliability and uptime
- Developer satisfaction with platform tools

### Platform Operator
**Role**: Operations teams responsible for running shared infrastucture, monitoring, and maintaining the platform in production. Shared infracture could include AKS cluster or APIM instance. 

**Key Needs**:
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Troubleshooting and diagnostic tools
- Capacity planning and cost management
- Security and compliance oversight

**Success Metrics**:
- Platform availability and performance
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Cost optimisation achievements
- Security compliance adherence

### Platform Consumer
**Role**: Development teams and engineers who consume infrastructure services to build and deploy applications. These teasm may also consume shared infrastucture supplied by the Platform Operators. For instance, they might deploy to a shared AKS cluster or a shared APIM instance. 

**Key Needs**:
- Simple, self-service infrastructure provisioning
- Clear documentation and examples
- Quick turnaround for infrastructure requests
- Consistent interfaces across all services

**Success Metrics**:
- Time from request to provisioned infrastructure
- Developer velocity improvements
- Reduction in infrastructure-related support tickets
- User satisfaction scores

## Key Business Objectives

### 1. Improve Developer Velocity
- **Target**: Reduce infrastructure provisioning time from days/weeks to minutes/hours
- **Measures**: Time to provision, deployment frequency, lead time for changes

### 2. Enable Self-Service Capabilities
- **Target**: 80% of infrastructure requests fulfilled without manual intervention
- **Measures**: Self-service adoption rate, support ticket reduction, user autonomy metrics

### 3. Reduce Cognitive Load
- **Target**: Abstract infrastructure complexity from development teams
- **Measures**: Learning curve reduction, onboarding time, documentation effectiveness

### 4. Centralise and Standardise Infrastructure
- **Target**: Consistent infrastructure patterns across all teams and environments
- **Measures**: Standard compliance rate, configuration drift reduction, policy adherence

### 5. Enable Multi-Tenancy
- **Target**: Secure, isolated infrastructure sharing across multiple teams/projects
- **Measures**: Tenant isolation effectiveness, resource utilisation efficiency, cost allocation accuracy

## Success Criteria

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Core infrastructure services available via self-service
- Basic monitoring and governance in place
- Initial set of development teams onboarded
- Documented standards and patterns established

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Comprehensive service catalogue available
- Advanced monitoring and cost management
- Multi-tenant isolation fully implemented
- 50%+ reduction in manual infrastructure requests

### Long-term (12+ months)
- Platform becomes the default for all infrastructure needs
- Measurable improvements in developer velocity
- Cost optimisation through economies of scale realised
- Platform expansion to support new use cases and technologies

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Platform Adoption
- Number of active platform consumers
- Percentage of infrastructure managed through platform
- Service catalogue utilisation rates

### Operational Excellence
- Platform uptime and availability
- Mean time to provision infrastructure
- Incident response and resolution times

### Business Impact
- Developer productivity improvements
- Cost savings through standardisation
- Reduction in security and compliance incidents
- Time to market improvements for new applications

## Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing enterprise systems
- Security and compliance requirements must be maintained
- Legacy system migration considerations
- Technology refresh and upgrade cycles

### Organisational Constraints
- Change management and user adoption challenges
- Skills development and training requirements
- Budget and resource allocation
- Regulatory and governance requirements

### Risk Factors
- Platform reliability and single points of failure
- Vendor lock-in considerations
- Security vulnerabilities in shared infrastructure
- Resistance to change from existing practices
