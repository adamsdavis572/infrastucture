## Feature: Shared Ingress Capability

### Requirement ID: REQ-001

**Description**: The platform must provide a shared ingress capability that serves as the centralised entry point for all HTTPS traffic across the organisation. This capability combines Content Delivery Network (CDN), Web Application Firewall (WAF), and API Management services to provide a unified, secure, and performant gateway for external traffic routing to backend services.

**Actors**: 
- Platform Consumer (Development Teams)
- Platform Operator (Infrastructure Operations)
- External Users/Clients
- Platform Builder (Platform Engineering Team)

**Preconditions**: 
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions is configured
- DNS management capability is available for domain configuration
- Backend services are deployed and accessible via private endpoints
- SSL/TLS certificates are available for custom domains

**Postconditions**: 
- External traffic is routed through the shared ingress capability
- All traffic benefits from CDN caching and acceleration
- WAF protection is applied to all incoming requests
- API management policies are enforced consistently
- Backend services receive filtered and validated traffic

**Acceptance Criteria**:
* The ingress capability must support multiple custom domain configurations (e.g., product1.insurancetechnology.com, product2.insurancetechnology.com)
* CDN functionality must be enabled with global edge locations for performance optimisation
* WAF policies must be configurable and applied to all frontend hosts
* API Management must support multiple backend pools with health monitoring
* Routing rules must be configurable to direct traffic based on URL patterns and hostnames
* The capability must support private connectivity to backend services via private endpoints
* Configuration must be declarative and manageable through the platform's self-service interface

**Implemented By**:
* TASK-001: Design Azure Front Door composition for CDN and WAF
* TASK-002: Implement Azure API Management composition with custom domains
* TASK-003: Create routing configuration abstraction

### Requirement ID: REQ-002

**Description**: The ingress capability must provide comprehensive external endpoint configuration management, allowing platform consumers to define DNS names, API specifications, security policies, and downstream service connections through a declarative interface.

**Actors**: 
- Platform Consumer (Development Teams)
- Platform Operator (Infrastructure Operations)
- External API Consumers

**Preconditions**: 
- Ingress capability infrastructure is deployed and operational
- Backend services are available and have defined API contracts
- Domain ownership is verified and SSL certificates are provisioned

**Postconditions**: 
- External endpoints are configured and accessible via specified DNS names
- API specifications are published and enforced
- Security policies are applied consistently across all endpoints
- Downstream service routing is established and functional

**Acceptance Criteria**:
* Platform consumers must be able to specify custom DNS names for their services
* API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger) must be configurable and automatically enforced
* Security policies including rate limiting, IP filtering, and authentication must be configurable per endpoint
* Downstream service selection must support multiple backend options with load balancing
* Health checks must be automatically configured for all downstream services
* Endpoint configuration changes must be validated before deployment
* API versioning must be supported through URL path or header-based routing

**Implemented By**:
* TASK-004: Implement DNS name configuration abstraction
* TASK-005: Create API specification management interface
* TASK-006: Develop security policy configuration framework

### Requirement ID: REQ-003

**Description**: The ingress capability must provide advanced traffic management and security features including Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection, Front Door ID validation, IP filtering, and custom rule sets to ensure robust security posture for all external-facing applications.

**Actors**: 
- Platform Operator (Security Operations)
- Platform Consumer (Development Teams)
- Security Team
- External Users/Clients

**Preconditions**: 
- Azure Front Door and API Management services are deployed
- Security policies and compliance requirements are defined
- Threat intelligence feeds are available for WAF rule updates

**Postconditions**: 
- All external traffic is protected by WAF policies
- Malicious traffic is blocked before reaching backend services
- Security events are logged and monitored
- Compliance requirements are met for external-facing applications

**Acceptance Criteria**:
* WAF policies must include OWASP Top 10 protection rules
* Front Door ID validation must be enforced at the API Management layer
* IP filtering capabilities must support allowlists and blocklists
* Custom rule sets must be configurable for specific application requirements
* Security events must be logged to a centralised monitoring system
* WAF rules must be automatically updated with latest threat intelligence
* DDoS protection must be enabled and configured appropriately
* Rate limiting must be configurable per endpoint and per client

**Implemented By**:
* TASK-007: Implement WAF policy composition
* TASK-008: Create Front Door ID validation policies
* TASK-009: Develop IP filtering and rate limiting framework

### Requirement ID: REQ-004

**Description**: The ingress capability must support multiple backend service types and provide flexible routing mechanisms to connect frontend endpoints with appropriate downstream services, including support for private endpoint connectivity and service discovery.

**Actors**: 
- Platform Consumer (Development Teams)
- Platform Operator (Infrastructure Operations)
- Backend Service Owners

**Preconditions**: 
- Backend services are deployed and accessible
- Network connectivity between ingress components and backend services is established
- Service discovery mechanisms are available

**Postconditions**: 
- Frontend requests are successfully routed to appropriate backend services
- Backend service health is continuously monitored
- Traffic distribution is optimised across available backend instances
- Private network connectivity is maintained for security

**Acceptance Criteria**:
* The capability must support routing to multiple backend service types (APIs, web applications, microservices)
* Backend service selection must be configurable through declarative specifications
* Health monitoring must be implemented for all backend connections
* Load balancing algorithms must be configurable (round-robin, weighted, least connections)
* Private endpoint connectivity must be supported for enhanced security
* Failover mechanisms must be implemented for backend service unavailability
* Service discovery integration must support dynamic backend registration
* Backend connection pooling and timeout configuration must be available

**Implemented By**:
* TASK-010: Implement backend service abstraction layer
* TASK-011: Create health monitoring and failover mechanisms
* TASK-012: Develop private endpoint connectivity framework
